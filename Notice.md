🚨 NEW UPDATE: Force Cooldown Feature 🚨

To make activities more human-like, we've implemented the *Force Cooldown* feature. This splits your searches into 3 parts, regardless of cooldown availability:

🖥️ PC Searches:
- Round 1️⃣: 8-9 searches
- Round 3️⃣: 8-9 searches
- Round 5️⃣: 8-9 searches
- Round 1️⃣7️⃣: 8-9 searches or remaining searches 

📱 Mobile Searches:
- Round 8️⃣: 8-9 searches
- Round 1️⃣1️⃣: 8-9 searches
- Round 1️⃣3️⃣: 8-9 searches

This makes detection by Microsoft even harder and increases your chances of success during redemption! 🎉

👉 Update your settings from GitHub to enable this feature:
"ForceCooldown": true



🔧 Under Development: Outlook Mail Warmup 🔧

This warmup process could *greatly* increase your chances of success during redemption! 🎯

Stay tuned for more updates on this upcoming feature!
