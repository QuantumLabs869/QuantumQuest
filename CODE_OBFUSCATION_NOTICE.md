# About Code Obfuscation

## Why is the Code Obfuscated?

The code here is obfuscated mainly to protect it. The goal is to keep the inner workings and techniques secure from reverse engineering. This doesn’t mean we’re doing anything shady like stealing data. It’s just a precaution to keep our code safe.

## Addressing Concerns

I understand that obfuscated code can be a bit concerning. Please rest assured that there’s no malicious intent. However, if you want to make sure the code is safe before running it, here are a few ways to do that:

### How to Test Safely

If you don’t have access to a virtual machine or sandbox, you can still test the code safely using these methods:

1. **Local Containers**: Use tools like Docker to run the code in a controlled environment. Docker containers help isolate the code from your main system. You can find setup instructions for Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Virtual Machines**: Set up a virtual machine (VM) to test the code in an isolated environment. This helps ensure that any potential issues don’t affect your main system. You can use software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) for this purpose.
